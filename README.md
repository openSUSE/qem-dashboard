# QEM Dashboard

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/openSUSE/qem-dashboard/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/openSUSE/qem-dashboard?branch=main)

The QEM Dashboard is a graphical user interface addon for [qem-bot](https://github.com/openSUSE/qem-bot). It can show
the current state for all incidents that are being processed. To help identify which tests are currently blocking
which incidents. Its deployment happens once a day via
[GitLab pipelines](https://gitlab.suse.de/opensuse/qem-dashboard/-/pipeline_schedules).

## Getting Started

  To get started all you need is an empty PostgreSQL database and the following dependencies:

    $ sudo zypper in -C postgresql-server postgresql-contrib
    $ sudo zypper in -C perl-Mojolicious perl-Mojolicious-Plugin-Webpack \
      perl-Mojo-Pg perl-Mojo-RabbitMQ-Client perl-Cpanel-JSON-XS perl-JSON-Validator perl-IO-Socket-SSL \
      npm
    $ npm install

Update the config file `dashboard.yml` to point to your PostgreSQL database (and other services where appropriate):

    ---
    secrets:
      - some_secret_to_protect_sessions
    pg: postgresql://postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres
    rabbitmq: amqp://user:password@rabbit.suse.de:5672
    tokens:
      - a_secret_token_openQABot_will_use
    status: 0
    openqa:
      url: https://openqa.opensuse.org
    obs:
      url: https://build.opensuse.org
    smelt:
      url: https://smelt.suse.de


And finally use the `mojo webpack` development web server to make the web application available under
`http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

    $ mojo webpack script/dashboard
    Web application available at http://127.0.0.1:3000

  [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) as a reference

If this is too much hassle for you feel free to provide incomplete pull requests for consideration or create an issue

### Local Testing

To execute all tests a PostgreSQL instance is needed and needs to specified in the environment variable `TEST_ONLINE`.
For a local PostgreSQL instance with a username and password one could call:

```
TEST_ONLINE=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres prove -l t/*.t t/*.t.js
```
### Further notes
A containerized environment could be used to build and run the dashboard and its dependencies.
For a concrete example, checkout the (so far) internal documentation under
https://gitlab.suse.de/qe-core/dev-dashboard.
